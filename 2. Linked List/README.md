2.1 Remove Dups: 

	Write code to remove duplicates from an unsorted linked list.
	
	FOLLOW UP
	How would you solve this problem if a temporary buffer is not allowed?

2.2 Return Kth to Last:  

	Implement an algorithm to find the kth to last element of a singly linked list.

2.3 Delete Middle Node:

	Implement an algorithm to delete a node in the middle 
	(i.e., any node but the first and last node, not necessarily the exact middle) of a singly linked list, 
	given only access to that node.
	
	EXAMPLE
	Input: the node c from the linked list a->b->c->d->e->f
	Result: nothing is returned, but the new linked list looks like a->b->d->e->f->

2.4 Partition:

	Write code to partition a linked list around a value x, 
	such that all nodes less than x come before nodes greater than or equal to x.
