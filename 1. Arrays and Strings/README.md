1.1 Is Unique: 
  
  Implement an algorithm to determine if a string has all unique characters. What if you connot use additional data structures?

1.2 Check Permutation:
  
  Given two strings, write a method to decide if one is a permutation of the other.

1.3 URlify:

  Write a method to replace all spaces in a string with '%20'. You may assume that the string has sufficient space at the end to hold the additional characters, and that you are given the "true" length of the string. 
  
  EXAMPLE
  
  
  Input:    "Mr John Smith     ", 13
  
  
  Output:   "Mr%20John%20Smith"


1.4 Palindrome Permutation:
  
  Given a string, write a function to check if it is a permutation of a palindrome. A palindrome is a word or phrase that is the amse forwards and backwards. A permutation is a rearrangement of letters. The palindrome does not need to be limited to just dictionary words.

  EXAMPLE

  Input:  Tact Coa
  
  
  Output: True (permutations: "taco cat","atco cta", etc.)

1.5 One Away:

  There are three types of edits taht can be performed on strings: insert a character, remove a character, or replace a character. Given two strings, write a function to check if they are one edit (or zero edit) away.

  EXAMPLE
  
  Input:                    Output:
  
  
  pale, ple       ->        true
  
  
  pales, pale     ->        true
  
  
  pale, bale      ->        true
  
  
  pale, bake      ->        false
